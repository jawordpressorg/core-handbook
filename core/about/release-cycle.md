# How the Release Cycle Works

A group of contributors from different Make teams leads each WordPress release cycle.

A release cycle usually lasts around 4 months, from the initial scoping meeting to the launch of the version.

The [6.2 release cycl](https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-2/)e ended on March 29, 2023.

A release cycle follows the following pattern:

*   **Phase 1: Planning and securing team leads.** This is done in the **[#core](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C02RQBWTW)** channel. The release lead discusses features for the next release of WordPress. WordPress contributors get involved in that discussion. The release lead will identify focus leads for each of the features.
*   **Phase 2: Development work begins.** Focus leads assemble teams and work on their assigned features. Regular chats are scheduled to ensure the development keeps moving forward.
*   **Phase 3:** **Beta.** Betas are released, and beta testers are asked to start reporting bugs. No more commits for new enhancements or feature requests are allowed for the rest of the release.
*   **Phase 4: Release Candidate.** There is a string freeze from this point on. Work is targeted on regressions(introduced during the current cycle) only.
*   **Phase 5: Launch.** WordPress version is launched and made available in the WordPress Admin for updates.

The launch is often followed soon after by a minor release (also known as a point release) as bugs are reported and squashed. A minor release is intended for bug fixes and enhancements that do not add new deployed files and are at the discretion of the release lead with suggestions/input from component maintainers and committers.
