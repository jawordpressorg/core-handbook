**a11y**

Accessibility, or the act of ensuring a high quality experience for all users regardless of blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#a11y)

**admin**

(and super admin) [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#admin)

**alpha (beta)**

Pre-release version of software intended to signal desire for compatibility, functional, and unit tests and feedback. Also see [release candidate](#release-candidate). [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#alpha-beta)

**back compat**

Backward compatibility – a desire to ensure that plugins and themes do not break under new releases – is a driving philosophy of WordPress. While it is a commonly accepted software development practice to break compatibility in major releases, WordPress strives to avoid this at all costs. Any backward incompatible change is carefully considered by the entire core development team and announced, with affected plugins often contacted. It should be noted that external libraries, such as jQuery, do have backward incompatible changes between major releases, which is often going to be a greater concern for developers. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#back-compat)

**backport**

A port is when code from one branch (or trunk) is merged into another branch or trunk. Some changes in WordPress point releases are the result of backporting code from trunk to the release branch. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#backport)

**bleeding edge**

The latest revision of the software, generally in development and often unstable. Also known as [trunk](#trunk). [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#bleeding-edge)

**blog**

(versus network, site) [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#blog)

**branch**

A directory in Subversion. WordPress uses branches to store the latest development code for each major release (3.9, 4.0, etc.). Branches are then updated with code for any minor releases of that branch. Sometimes, a major version of WordPress and its minor versions are collectively referred to as a “branch”, such as “the 4.0 branch”. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#branch)

**bug**

A bug is an error or unexpected result. Performance improvements, code optimization, and are considered enhancements, not defects. After feature freeze, only bugs are dealt with, with regressions (adverse changes from the previous version) being the highest priority. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#bug)

**command line interface (CLI)**

A type of human-computer interface (i.e., a way for humans to interact with computers) that relies solely on textual input and output.

[#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#command-line-interface)

**commit (noun)**

An individual change to WordPress, identified by an incremental revision number. Also called a **changeset**. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#commit-noun)

To make a change to WordPress. Only committers can commit code, but often the code is *contributed* by developers without commit access. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#commit-verb)

**committer**

A developer with commit access. WordPress has five lead developers and four permanent core developers with commit access. Additionally, the project usually has a few guest or component committers – a developer receiving commit access, generally for a single release cycle (sometimes renewed) and/or for a specific component. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#committer)

**conflict**

A conflict occurs when a patch changes code that was modified after the patch was created. These patches are considered *stale*, and will require a *refresh* of the changes before it can be applied, or the conflicts will need to be *resolved*. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#conflict)

**copyright license**

Copyright holders may grant a license with various allowances including the ability to modify or distribute the copyrighted material. Also see [GPL](#gpl). [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#copyright-license)

**CSS**

Cascading Style Sheets. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#css)

**dev note**

Each important change in WordPress Core is documented in a developers note, (usually called dev note). Good dev notes generally include a description of the change, the decision that led to this change, and a description of how developers are supposed to work with that change. Dev notes are published on Make/Core blog during the beta phase of WordPress release cycle. Publishing dev notes is particularly important when plugin/theme authors and WordPress developers need to be aware of those changes.In general, all dev notes are compiled into a Field Guide at the beginning of the release candidate phase. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#dev-note)

**docblock**

**enhancement**

Enhancements are simple improvements to WordPress, such as the addition of a hook, a new feature, or an improvement to an existing feature. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#enhancement)

**feature request**

A feature request should generally begin the process in the ideas forum, on a mailing list, as a plugin, or brought to the attention of the core team, such as through scope meetings held for each major release. Unsolicited tickets of this variety are typically, therefore, discouraged. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#feature-request)

**Field guide**

The field guide is a type of blogpost published on Make/Core during the release candidate phase of the [WordPress release cycle](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/).

Other examples of locales include Canadian English and U.S. English. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#locale)

**major release**

A release, identified by the first two numbers (3.6), which is the focus of a full release cycle and feature development.

Changes to point releases are carefully considered, and only critical or blocker\-level bugs, and security enhancements, hardening, and fixes are accepted. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#point-release)

**priority (bug tracker)**

The seriousness of a bug report or ticket in the eyes of the project. Generally, **severity** is a judgment of how bad a bug is, while priority is its relationship to other bugs. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#priority-bug-tracker)

**priority (hooks)**

(higher priority means lower number) [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#priority-hooks)

**punt**

Contributors sometimes use the verb “punt” when talking about a ticket. This means it is being pushed out to a future release. This typically occurs for lower priority tickets near the end of the release cycle that don’t “make the cut.” In this is colloquial usage of the word, it means to delay or equivocate. (It also describes a play in American football where a team essentially passes up on an opportunity, hoping to put themselves in a better position later to try again.) [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#punt)

**security issue**

A security issue is a type of bug that can affect the security of WordPress installations. Specifically, it is a report of a bug that you have found in the WordPress core code, and that you have determined can be used to gain some level of access to a site running WordPress that you should not have. [#](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#security-issue)
