**Inline documentation**

Inline documentation refers to concise comments added directly within the code to explain its functionality, usage, and purpose. In WordPress, inline docs help developers understand how functions, classes, hooks, and parameters work by providing clear, structured explanations. These comments follow standardized formats such as PHPDoc for PHP files and JSDoc for JavaScript files. Well-written inline documentation improves code readability, makes maintenance easier, and enhances collaboration within the developer community. Contributing to inline docs ensures that WordPress remains well-documented and accessible to both new and experienced developers.

Refer to [Inline Documentation Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/inline-documentation-standards/) on the developer documentation page.
