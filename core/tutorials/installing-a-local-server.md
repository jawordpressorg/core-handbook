# Installing a Local Server

This section of the handbook contains tutorials that will walk you through the process of installing one of the four local server programs listed below.

## Why do I need a local server?

A local server provides the same environment as your web host’s server, allows you to install/run WordPress trunk on your computer, and is an essential tool in contributing to the development of WordPress core.

## What does AMP stand for?

Some local server programs have **AMP** in their name, which stands for **A**pache, **M**ySQL (or **M**ariaDB), and **P**HP. These are the same programs that are installed on your webhost’s server which allow you to run your WordPress site.

## Which local server should I install?

The four popular local servers are (not in any particular order):

*   [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) (Mac & Windows)
*   [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/) (Windows)
*   [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (Windows, Mac, Linux)
*   [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) (VVV – WordPress specific Vagrant configuration for Windows, Mac, Linux)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (Mac, Windows, Linux)

Your choice of a local server program will primarily depend on which operating system you run on your computer. There are a couple that work on multiple operating systems, and all will give you a solid local development environment.
