# Contribute with Docs

There are many ways in which it is possible to contribute to the Documentation team.

Most of the Documentation Team work ends up in one of these two sites:

*   [developer.wordpress.org](https://developer.wordpress.org/) (aka *DevHub*) – This is where all the documentation aimed to developers are, such as Code reference, Plugins and Themes development handbooks and more.
*   [wordpress.org/support](https://wordpress.org/support) (aka *HelpHub*) – This is where all the documentation aimed to the end-user are, such as Installation instructions, Admin panel reference and more.

If you want to contribute to WordPress Docs, check out the [Documentation Team’s handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/).
