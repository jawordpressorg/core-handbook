<!-- ## Contribute with Testing -->
## テストでコントビュートする

Testing is a very important part of the release cycle. You can install the latest development version locally to test new features, and how the changes work with your site setup (theme/plugins/etc.). You can [start testing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/) as soon as a new development version is available (alpha), and continue throughout the release cycle to ensure the next version of WordPress is as bug\-free as possible.

You don’t need to know how to code or create a patch, just provide a [well-written bug report](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-bugs/), with details of the issue and steps to reproduce. You can confirm the issue is fixed once a patch is committed and a new bleeding edge nightly version released.

Found a security vulnerability? WordPress believes in responsible and private disclosure. [Report it directly to our security team.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/)

## Contribute with Code

Whether you need to report one bug and provide a patch to fix it, or wish to become involved in maintaining one or more WordPress components, contributing code is a great way to improve WordPress. This section walks through [the WordPress codebase](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/codebase/) and how it’s laid out, then teaches you more about [the code repository](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/svn/) and [our bug tracker (Trac)](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/trac/).

[Design decisions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/design-decisions/) made within WordPress are often a consideration when contributing code and are outlined in this section as well. Finally, if you’re interested in [fixing bugs](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/fixing-bugs/), our walkthrough is made to get you quickly started.

## Best Practices

Over time, the WordPress community has developed some [best practices](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/), which keep the code base consistent and understandable by the community.

In the best practices section, we outline the [coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) for [CSS](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/css/), [HTML](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/html/), [JavaScript](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/javascript/), and [PHP](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/). Additionally, [inline documentation standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/) for both [JavaScript](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/javascript/) and [PHP](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/) are documented in-depth.

Finally, the section walks through the [Core APIs](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/core-apis/) and the best practices to follow when [writing patches](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/writing-patches/).

## Tutorials & Guides

Completely new to WordPress development? In this section, we include a number of [tutorials and guides](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/) to help get you setup. Whether you want to [setup WordPress for local development](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-wordpress-locally/), [install a local server](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/), [install a version control system (VCS)](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-vcs/), understand how to [work with patches](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/working-with-patches/), or better understand how to [work with Trac](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/trac/), we have you covered.
